Yuzu? More like you zoom! Hahaha. I'm going to make this line really long so that it keeps on running and stuff so that oh fuck we should deal with the fact that it should run over so I can also just see how many characters fit and then say do a new line if it does that as well. Is that what's optimal though? I'm not really sure.
Also, you've unlocked dash. Press x.
What a cool kid.
