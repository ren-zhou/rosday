Press Z to stall. It can have 2 effects:
1. Freeze you for a moment, zeroing your velocity. This can allow you to get across gaps you might not be able to otherwise.
2. Bounce you upwards. This'll happen if there are spikes within your stall radius. You maintain your x-velocity, are bounced upwards, and get your double jump back.
You can stall 3 times. If you bounce, you get your stall back, but you cannot attempt a stall if you've used all 3.@
Also, don't go back into the other room because I don't have good room transitions set up lol.
>>>>>
Go finish. I already explained how to do this.@
